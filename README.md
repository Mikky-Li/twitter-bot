# twitter-bot

Including two different bots.

1、
Just run download_bot.py and it'll reply video downloading links to anyone who mentioned you under a video tweets. 

2、
Just run translate_bot.py and it'll reply translated text of the original tweet to anyone who mentioned you under the original tweets. Here I used deep-translator, simply because of the fact DeepL is currently not available in my country. deep-translator is easy-to-use and unlimited

However, you need to create and use your own Twitter Tokens, innit?
