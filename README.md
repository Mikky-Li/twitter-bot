# twitter-bot

Including two different bots.

1、
Just run download_bot.py and it'll reply video downloading links to anyone who mentioned you under a video tweets. I used SSSTwitter to create video links simply because the link structure is pretty clear and straight forward. If you got all the information about the tweets, you can get the link

2、
Just run translate_bot.py and it'll reply translated text of the original tweet to anyone who mentioned you under the original tweets. Here I used deep-translator, simply because of the fact DeepL is currently not available in my country. deep-translator is easy-to-use and unlimited

However, you need to create and use your own Twitter Tokens, innit?
